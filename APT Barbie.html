    <h1>APT Barbie</h1>

    <div class="scene">
        <p>It's a beautiful clear blue morning sky, as a black Audi RS3 pulls into a shopping center parking lot. A female journalist’s voice crackles over the radio—<em>“Law enforcement officials this morning are still refusing to release details regarding last month’s cyber attack against—”</em> The engine and radio both fall silent to the sounds of birds chirping in the distance.</p>
        
        <p>The driver’s door opens. A young blonde woman in her early twenties steps out, oversized sunglasses masking her expression. She moves with quiet confidence towards the entrance of a Sephora, her reflection briefly caught in the sliding glass door before she disappears inside.</p>
        
        <p>Moments later, a Maryland State Police Ford Explorer rolls past, slow and deliberate. Behind it, an unmarked black Chevy Tahoe follows, its tinted windows revealing nothing. <strong>Its white Federal license plate with blue lettering lingers before vanishing from view.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Inside, she counts out crisp $50 bills, her tone cheerful, polite. <strong>The cashier hands her a bag, smiles and tells her to have a great day.</strong> She exits, stepping into the sunlight.</p>
        
        <p>Suddenly—<strong>the sharp metallic clank of a pump-action shotgun racking a shell into its chamber.</strong></p>
        
        <p><em>"DON’T MOVE! STATE POLICE! SHOW ME YOUR FUCKING HANDS!"</em></p>
        
        <p>She flinches—<strong>The shopping bag slips from her hand, hitting the pavement with a soft, hollow thud.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="cut">CUT TO BLACK</div>

    <div class="scene">
        <p>A muffled ding. The doors of an elevator slide open, and a man in an <strong>Army green uniform</strong> steps inside, followed by a younger man in a black suit. The uniformed man pulls a key from his pocket, inserts it into a lock on the panel, turns it and presses five. The elevator begins to descend.</p>
        
        <p><em>"Sir, I have to ask... the FrostyGoop payload she—"</em></p>
        
        <p>A sharp glance cuts him off.</p>
        
        <p><em>"Kenneth, this isn't Langely. Everyone here at Meade gets paid to be quiet."</em></p>
        
        <p><em>"Sorry, sir. It’s just—with the recent Chinese telco compromises—"</em></p>
        
        <p>A pause. Then, <strong>a smile with a calm but final:</strong> <em>"Son... This might be your only trip down here, so listen up. Roughly two years ago Uncle Sam caught her hand in the cookie jar, threw a black bag over her head and now she’s on a classified contract. But the most important thing?"</em></p>
        
        <p>The elevator slows. A beat of silence.</p>
        
        <p><em>"If we're not in a SCIF—we don’t discuss her operations."</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="cut">DING. The doors slide open.</div>

    <div class="scene">
        <p>A vast <strong>cubicle farm</strong> stretches into the darkness—<strong>empty, windowless, lifeless, abandoned.</strong> The soft, haunting notes of <strong>Portishead’s "Roads"</strong> drift through the space, the melancholic melody echoing off the walls.</p>
        
        <p>Kenneth hesitates, looking to the uniformed man, as he removes the elevator key and steps forward <strong>without pause</strong>, moving through the darkness like he’s done this a hundred times before. Kenneth follows. Their footsteps are the only sound aside from the music.</p>
        
        <p>At the far end of the completely dark room, a <strong>faint neon pink glow</strong> at a lone workstation in the back corner provides the only light. A slight <strong>humming of monitors</strong> fills the space against the music. The pink light morphs like the flame of a candle against the edges of cubicle walls as they approach.</p>
        
        <p>The song’s lyrics whisper through the air—</p>

        <p><em>"Ohh, can't anybody see? We've got a war to fight... Never found our way... Regardless of what they say..."</em></p>

        <p>They round the final corner.</p>

        <p>A <strong>figure sits at a desk</strong> with a pink lava lamp, <strong>writing code</strong>, fully immersed in the glow of <strong>four monitors streaming lines of data, live attack feeds, and a world most people will never see.</strong> The person’s back is to them, a <strong>pink hoodie with cat ears</strong> pulled over their head, the glow of the screens casting a soft outline around them.</p>

        <p>The music swells— The figure stops typing—</p>

        <p><em>"From this moment... How can it feel, this wrong?"</em></p>

        <p>The uniformed man doesn’t break stride. His voice cuts through the song, firm, sharp, unwavering.</p>

        <p><strong>"How many dag on times have I told you that this is a military installation, and you will dress appropriately?"</strong></p>

        <p>With the slight stroke of the mouse and a solitary click, the music <strong>cuts out.</strong></p>

        <p>A <strong>tiny, faint meow</strong> breaks the silence.</p>

        <p>The chair <strong>slowly turns.</strong></p>

        <p>The blonde woman from the parking lot sits before them, <strong>legs crossed, expression bored</strong>, idly stroking a <strong>tiny kitten curled in her lap.</strong> She lets the moment linger before rolling her eyes, <strong>mock-dramatic.</strong></p>

        <p><em>"I'm still wearing the ankle bracelet. That should be enough for you."</em></p>

        <p>The uniformed man exhales slowly, closing his eyes briefly before opening them and turning to Kenneth.</p>

        <p><strong>"Special Agent Kenneth Dahl, this is Barbara. She's one of our black hat hackers. Some Neanderthals around here like to call her APT Barbie."</strong></p>

        <p>Barbara rolls her eyes again, this time showing actual contempt for the moniker. Kenneth, eager, steps forward, hand extended for a handshake.</p>

        <p>Barbara doesn’t move. Instead, she scoffs, still petting her kitten, then tilts her head slightly towards the uniformed man as if considering something before responding—<strong>half-singing, half-mocking, quoting Eminem:</strong></p>

        <p><em>"But what if he’s right and I’m just a criminal? Making a living off of the world’s misery... what in the world gives me the right?"</em></p>

        <p>The uniformed man clears his throat—<strong>a sharp, intentional cough.</strong></p>

        <p>Barbara smirks but says nothing more, her fingers tracing slow circles along the kitten’s fur.</p>

        <p>Kenneth <strong>slowly lowers his hand</strong> and innocently asks "So, uh, whats your cat's name?""</p>
		
        <p>Barbara's smirk grows wide as she looks Kenneth directly in the eyes and simply replies... </p>
		
		<p><strong>"Her name is Earned Privilege."</strong></p>
		
		<p>Kenneth lets a slight chuckle escape as Barbara's eyes and attention quickly shift down lovingly to her kitten.</p>
		
		<p>"...but Mommy calls her Privs."</p>
